Abstract
摘要
<br><br>
The reduction of ferric iron (Fe(III)) to ferrous iron (Fe(II)) by dissimilatory iron-reducing bacteria is widespread in anaerobic environments. The oxidation of Fe(II) in aerobic environments has been found to produce hydroxyl radicals (•OH); however, the role of iron-reducing bacteria in the process has not been well understood. Here, Shewanella oneidensis MR-1-mediated redox transformation of four typical iron (oxyhydr)oxides and the production of reactive oxygen species were investigated. The results showed that the production of •OH was mainly determined by the insoluble Fe(II) formed during microbially mediated reduction and also mediated by the mineralogical phase. Moreover, this study for the first time observed the exogenetic iron-independent production of •OH by S. oneidensis MR-1, and the integrated pathway of •OH generation during the iron redox process was revealed. Superoxide (O2•–) was indicated as a key intermediate species that was produced by both abiotic and biotic pathways, and •OH was generated by both the exogenetic iron-dependent Fenton-like reaction and exogenetic iron-independent pathways. S. oneidensis MR-1 played a pivotal role in both the reduction of Fe(III) and the production of O2•–. These findings contribute substantially to our understanding of the generation mechanism of reactive oxygen species at oxidation–reduction boundaries in the environment.

通过异化还原铁细菌将三价铁（Fe（III））还原为二价铁（Fe（II））在厌氧环境中非常普遍。已发现在好氧环境中氧化Fe（II）会产生羟基（•OH）；然而，还原铁细菌在该过程中的作用尚未被很好地理解。在这里，研究了印度希瓦氏菌（Shewanella oneidensis）MR-1介导的四种典型氧化铁（羟基氧化物）的氧化还原转化和活性氧的产生。结果表明，•OH的产生主要由微生物介导的还原过程中形成的不溶性Fe（II）决定，也由矿物相介导。此外，本研究首次观察到沙门氏菌MR-1外源铁不依赖于•OH的产生，揭示了铁氧化还原过程中•OH生成的整合途径。超氧化物（O2•–）被认为是通过非生物途径和生物途径产生的关键中间物种，而•OH是通过外源铁依赖性Fenton样反应和外源铁非依赖性途径生成的。oneidensis MR-1在还原Fe（III）和O2•–的产生中起着关键作用。这些发现大大有助于我们理解环境中氧化还原边界处活性氧的生成机理。•OH是通过外源铁依赖性芬顿样反应和外源铁非依赖性途径生成的。oneidensis MR-1在还原Fe（III）和O2•–的产生中起着关键作用。这些发现大大有助于我们理解环境中氧化还原边界处活性氧的生成机理。•OH是通过外源铁依赖性芬顿样反应和外源铁非依赖性途径生成的。oneidensis MR-1在还原Fe（III）和O2•–的产生中起着关键作用。这些发现大大有助于我们理解环境中氧化还原边界处活性氧的生成机理。

Reactive oxygen species (ROS), especially hydroxyl radicals (• OH), play important roles in the attenuation of contaminants in the environment.1−3 As is well known, Fenton and photo-Fenton reactions can produce large amounts of • OH and have been widely used for remediation of contaminated water or soils.4−6 Recently, the redox reaction of iron in subsurface sediments was found to produce • OH naturally, even in dark conditions without the presence of exogenous hydrogen peroxide (H2O2).2,7 These redox reactions mostly occur in the zones where the water table and redox dynamics continually change,8−10 leading to the redox cycling of iron,9 the changes in mineral speciation and morphology11 and the transformation of a wide variety of inorganic and organic contaminants in the environment as consequences.7,12,13

活性氧（ROS），特别是羟基自由基（•OH），在污染物在环境。作为众所周知，芬顿和photo-Fenton反应可产生大量的•OH已广泛用于污染修复水或土壤。最近，铁的氧化还原反应地下沉积物被发现自然产生•哦，即使在黑暗的环境中也没有外来的过氧化氢。这些氧化还原反应主要是发生在地下水位和氧化还原动力学不断变化，导致铁的氧化还原循环，物形态和形态的变化，以及多种无机和有机物的转化环境中的污染物。

In anaerobic environments, dissimilatory iron-reducing bacteria, such as Shewanella oneidensis, Geobacter sulfurreducens, and so forth, can utilize anaerobic respiration to produce electrons and then transfer them to Fe(III) in the environmental matrices through direct contact or electron shuttles, leading to the generation of Fe(II).14−17 This is an important process which affects the redox speciation of iron in groundwater, soils, and sediments.18−20 Previous studies have tried to elucidate the mechanisms of electron transfer between bacteria and minerals,21−24 to clarify the resulting effects on the cycles of carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur in terrestrial and aquatic environments,25−27 and to explore its applications in contamination remediation.

在厌氧环境中，异化的铁还原菌，如单胞谢万氏菌、硫化土杆菌等，可以利用厌氧呼吸产生电子，然后通过直接接触或电子穿梭将其转移到环境基质中的Fe（III），从而产生Fe（II）。这是影响地下水、土壤和沉积物中铁的氧化还原形态的一个重要过程。以往的研究试图阐明细菌与矿物之间电子转移的机制，阐明其对陆地和水环境中碳、氮和硫循环的影响，并探索其在污染修复中的应用。

When converting to an aerobic environment, Fe(II) is easily oxidized to Fe(III), accompanied by the spontaneous production of abundant • OH.1,7 Recent studies have been conducted to investigate the production of • OH through chemical oxidation of Fe(II)- bearing clays,13,30 sediments1,7 and ferrous minerals,31−34 and its effects on the oxidation of contaminants in the environment.1,12,13,30 Particularly, the research by Yuan et al.35 revealed the one-electron transfer mechanism of • OH production derived from oxygenation of chemically reduced structural Fe(II) in nontronite and pointed out that O2 •− and H2O2 were involved in the generation of • OH. Zeng et al.13 have reported the sustainable production of • OH from abiotic oxidation of structural Fe(II) in nontronite as well as its effects on the degradation of 1,4-dioxane. Although both chemical and biological reductions of structural Fe(III) to Fe(II) were adopted in their study, microorganisms were inactivated during the oxidation process, and their roles were therefore not elaborated. Yan et al.12 recently investigated the production of OH in a system containing S. oneidensis MR-1 and goethite and its effects on the degradation of enrofloxacin; however, only the role of S. oneidensis MR-1 in the dissimilatory reduction of Fe(III) was discussed, and whether S. oneidensis MR-1 contributed to the generation of • OH during the aerobic phase was neglected. We found that studies to date have only focused on the production of • OH during the abiotic oxidation of Fe(II)-containing minerals, and whether iron-reducing bacteria contribute to the production of • OH during the aerobic phase is still unknown. Furthermore, the pathway of • OH production during the microbially mediated reduction and re-oxidation of iron-containing minerals needs to be further explored.

当转化为好氧环境时，Fe（II）很容易氧化为Fe（III），伴随着大量的•哦，最近已经进行了研究，以调查通过含铁（II）粘土、沉积物和黑色矿物的化学氧化产生•OH的情况，以及它对环境中污染物氧化的影响。特别是袁等的研究。揭示了化学还原结构Fe（II）在非罗尼盐中氧化生成•OH的单电子转移机理，指出O2•-和H2O2参与了•OH的生成。Zeng等人。报道了非质子石中结构Fe（II）非生物氧化产生•OH的可持续性及其对1,4-二氧六环降解的影响。尽管在研究中采用了化学和生物两种方法将结构Fe（III）还原为Fe（II），但微生物在氧化过程中被灭活，因此它们的作用没有详细阐述。Yan等人。最近研究了在含有S.oneidensis MR-1和针铁矿的体系中产生OH及其对恩诺沙星降解的影响；然而，仅讨论了S.oneidensis MR-1在铁（III）的异化还原中的作用，忽略了S.oneidensis MR-1在有氧阶段是否促进了•OH的生成。我们发现，迄今为止的研究只集中在含铁矿物的非生物氧化过程中产生的•OH，而铁还原菌在好氧阶段是否参与了•OH的产生尚不清楚。此外，含铁矿物在微生物介导还原和再氧化过程中产生•OH的途径还有待进一步探索。

On the other hand, iron (oxyhydr)oxides such as ferrihydrite, lepidocrocite, goethite, and hematite are the major mineralogical phases of iron in soils and sediments. Previous studies have reported the influences of morphological properties such as particle size, shape, and crystallinity on both microbial and chemical reduction of iron (oxyhydr)- oxides.36−38 Bose et al. examined the microbial reduction of hematite nanoparticles and found that the bioreduction rate of hematite depended on its size, shape, exposed crystal faces, and aggregation state.37 Research by Roden showed that both short- and long-term bioreductions of various synthetic iron oxides were linearly correlated with their surface areas;36,39,40 however, research from Cutting et al. demonstrated that the crystallinity of the iron (oxyhydr)oxides rather than the surface area determined the initial rate of microbial iron reduction.38 Although inconsistent conclusions were obtained, there is no doubt that both the reduction rates and products are different for iron (oxyhydr)oxides with different morphological phases, which may further influence ROS production during the oxidation of reduced iron (oxyhydr)oxides.41 However, very few studies have addressed this issue until now, especially its coupling with the microbially mediated iron redox process. Therefore, the main objectives of this study were to (1) investigate the dissimilatory reduction of iron (oxyhydr)oxides with different mineralogical phases by S. oneidensis MR-1, a typical iron-reducing bacteria, and the resulting transformation of iron (oxyhydr)oxides after microbially mediated redox cycles, (2) quantify the • OH production during the microbially mediated redox transformation of different iron (oxyhydr)- oxides, and (3) explore the pathway of • OH production during the microbially mediated redox transformation of iron (oxyhydr)oxides. The results will improve our understanding of the coupling process of microbially mediated iron redox cycles and the natural occurrence of ROS production in the redox zones. ■ MATERIALS AND METHODS Materials. Coumarin (COU, 99%), 7-hydroxylcoumarin (7-hCOU, 98%), superoxide dismutase (SOD, from bovine kidney, 15 kU), catalase (CAT, from bovine liver, 2000−5000 units/mg) and nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT, 98%) were purchased from J&K Scientific (Beijing, China). Diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA, >99%) was purchased from Macklin Biochemical Technology Co. (Shanghai, China). 2,3- Bis(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide (XTT, >90%) and furfuryl alcohol (FFA, 98%) were purchased from Aldrich Chemicals (Milwaukee, USA). 2- Methyl-6-(4-methoxyphenyl)-3,7-dihydroimidazo[1,2-a]- pyrazin-3(7H)-one hydrochloride (MCLA, >98%) was obtained from TCI Development (Tokyo, Japan). All other chemicals used were of analytical grade. Hematite (99.8%) was purchased from Strem Chemicals (Newburyport, USA). Ferrihydrite, lepidocrocite, and goethite were synthesized using the methods reported in a previous study.42 Characterization results for the iron (oxyhydr)oxides are presented in the Supporting Information (Table S1). S. oneidensis MR-1, obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, USA), was incubated and harvested according to the procedure reported by Yan et al.43 After washing with sterile 0.1 M NaCl three times, the cells were resuspended in 0.1 M NaCl (1 × 1010 cells/mL). All containers used in the study were autoclaved to avoid interference from other microorganisms. Microbially Mediated Reduction and Oxidation of Iron (Oxyhydr)oxides. All solutions were prepared with Milli-Q water (18.2 MΩ), which was boiled and cooled with N2 gas purging to remove O2 in a glove box filled with N2 (85%), H2 (10%), and CO2 (5%). S. oneidensis MR-1 cells (108 cells/mL), measured by a UV−vis spectrophotometer (UV2600, Shimadzu, Japan) at a wavelength of 600 nm, were mixed with iron (oxyhydr)oxide suspensions (1 g/L) and lactate (10 mM) in 250 mL head space bottles which contained pH 7.0 bicarbonate buffered solutions (60 mM), as described in the study by Liu et al.44 In the anaerobic stage, the bottles were placed in a glove box and settled overnight to remove O2 and then capped with butyl rubber stoppers to avoid exposure to oxygen and incubated at 30 °C with continuous shaking (150 rpm) outside the glove box. After 2 days of anaerobic incubation, the bottles were opened to allow air exchange for oxygenation and covered with a sized piece of a sterile membrane (part number: YA0260, Solarbio, China) to prevent other microorganisms from entering and further incubated at 30 °C with continuous shaking (150 rpm). The bottles were exposed to anaerobic (2 days) and aerobic (1 day) conditions alternately. Four iron (oxyhydr)oxides were used to evaluate the reduction extent of Fe(III) by dissimilatory ironreducing bacteria S. oneidensis MR-1 and the yield of • OH during the oxidation of Fe(II). Five milliliter aliquot samples were taken at the end of each anaerobic and aerobic phase to measure dissolved Fe(II) and total Fe(II) concentrations as well as • OH production. The concentration of dissolved oxygen (DO) in the bottles and the solution pH value were measured during the redox cycles. An experimental group without S. oneidensis MR-1 was used as a control. • OH production upon oxygenation of Fe(II) in solution was detected as well. Triplicate bottles were set up for all the experiments. Determination of Fe(II). The concentration of Fe(II) was measured by the 1,10-o-phenanthroline analytical method at 510 nm using a UV−visible spectrophotometer45 with the detection limit of 0.1 mg/L. One milliliter of the suspension was extracted after the addition of 1 mL of 0.1 M HCl for 15 min and centrifuged for the determination of total Fe(II). For the analysis of the dissolved Fe(II), 1 mL of the suspensions was taken and centrifuged to obtain the supernatants in a glove box for the anaerobic samples and in a clean bench for the aerobic samples, respectively. The insoluble Fe(II) included both sorbed Fe(II) and particulate Fe(II), and its concentration was obtained by subtracting dissolved Fe(II) from total Fe(II). ROS Measurements. The production of • OH was determined using the fluorescence probing technique with COU.46 Briefly, 1 mL of the collected samples was added to 1 mL of 1.5 mM COU and exposed to air. According to the results of a preliminary experiment, the oxidation reaction could be finished within 3 h, and 7-hCOU was stable during this period. After 3 h, 0.5 mL of methanol was added to terminate the reaction. The concentration of • OH was obtained by measuring 7-hCOU, a strongly luminescent product, using a microplate reader (Varioskan Flash, Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) (the excitation/emission wavelengths were 350/460 nm) and calculated by the use of a calibration curve from 0.01 to 10 μM. The total amount of • OH produced was estimated as [7-hCOU]/14.5%.47 The detection limit of • OH using this method was 0.034 μM.46 For the detection of O2 •− produced by S. oneidensis MR-1, a modified on-line continuous flow chemiluminescence (CL) method was employed using MCLA as the trapping agent.48 Briefly, the device comprised two flow paths: a mixing cell, and a CL analyzer (Model MPI-B, Xi’an Remax Tech. Ltd., Xi’an, China). One flow path was connected to an MCLA reagent consisting of 4 μM MCLA in 50 mM sodium acetate with pH 6.0, and 50 μM DTPA was added to minimize the reduction of the O2 •− lifetime by trace metals. The other flow path was connected to the analyte. The MCLA reagent and analyte were pumped by a peristaltic pump with a flow rate of 2.4 mL/min and mixed in a mixing cell immediately adjacent to the detection loop, and the CL intensity was detected by a photomultiplier operated at 900 V. Twenty mM phosphate buffer solutions with 100 μM DTPA at pH 7.6 containing different concentrations of S. oneidensis MR-1 (0, 5 × 107 , 1 × 108 , 5 × 108 , 1 × 109 , 5 × 109 cells/mL) were examined by CL. The addition of SOD (30 U/mL) to the living S. oneidensis MR-1 (1 × 109 cells/mL) was used to quench the CL signal induced by O2 •−. The supernatants of S. oneidensis MR-1 (1 × 109 cells/mL) and autoclaved S. oneidensis MR-1 were also determined by the same method. O2 •− produced by oxidation of anaerobic samples containing microbes and iron (oxyhydr)oxides was determined by the formation of XTT formazan.49 NBT and SOD, the scavengers of O2 •−, were used to confirm the presence of O2 •− during the oxidation of anaerobic samples. H2O2 production was determined with the addition of CAT (100, 200, 500 U/ mL) to anaerobic samples and exposure to air atmosphere for oxidation, while the production by S. oneidensis MR-1 was determined by the I3 − method as described in Sekar and DiChristina.50 1 O2 generation was quantified by the loss of FFA.3,51 Details are presented in the Supporting Information. Identification of Transformations of Iron (Oxyhydr)- oxides. Mineralogical changes of iron (oxyhydr)oxides after redox cycles were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and field-emission high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) coupled with selected area electron diffraction (SAED) (JEM-2100F, JEOL, Japan). All the details are provided in the Supporting Information. Statistical Analysis. Significant differences between the data were assessed with one-way analysis of variance followed by Duncan’s multiple range test at p < 0.01 using the SPSS19.0 software.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Production of Fe(II) and Transformation of Iron (Oxyhydr)oxides during Microbially Mediated Redox Cycles. Four different iron (oxyhydr)oxides were incubated with S. oneidensis MR-1 under oscillating redox cycles. The DO concentration and pH were discontinuously detected during the redox cycles (Figure S1). Under anaerobic conditions, the DO concentration was below 0.1 mg/L, and solution pH was around 7.0, both of which increased sharply and reached a plateau after exposure to air atmosphere for 1.5 h with no significant differences (p < 0.01) among the four iron (oxyhydr)oxides. When changed to anaerobic conditions again, the DO concentration and pH dropped to the initial level within 1 h. The oscillating changes of DO concentration confirmed the redox cycles occurring during incubation. The changes of pH when the systems were shifted between anaerobic and aerobic conditions were likely due to the generation of H+ during Fe(III) reduction and the consumption of H+ during the Fe(II) oxidation reaction, respectively. The total Fe(II) changed periodically between anaerobic and aerobic phases during the redox cycles (Figure 1a), and the average total Fe(II) contents in the anaerobic samples from the four redox cycles were calculated and are presented in Figure 1b. The results showed that the content of the total Fe(II) produced by microbial reduction was similar for ferrihydrite and lepidocrocite (about 110 mg/g), which was much higher than the concentration for hematite and goethite (lower than 25 mg/g), indicating that hematite and goethite were more stable than ferrihydrite and lepidocrocite under conditions of the current study. Munch and Ottow also found that microbial reduction was more obvious for noncrystalline iron oxides than crystalline iron oxides,52 consistent with what we observed in the first anaerobic phase, indicating that amorphous ferric (oxyhydr)oxides are more likely to be reduced than crystalline iron (oxyhydr)oxides by microbially mediated reduction. When converted into aerobic conditions, the Fe(II) produced was almost completely oxidized with only the exception of lepidocrocite; while when changed to anaerobic conditions again, a similar amount of Fe(II) was reproduced. The amount of Fe(II) produced was determined by the morphological properties of iron (oxyhydr)oxides and the secondary minerals formed as well. The total Fe(II) included dissolved Fe(II) and insoluble Fe(II), and the content of the insoluble Fe(II) in each sample could be calculated by subtracting water-extracted Fe(II) from the total Fe(II) (Table S2). Notably, the insoluble Fe(II) accounted for 70−84% of the total Fe(II) in the iron (oxyhydr)oxide samples after microbial reduction and followed the order ferrihydrite > lepidocrocite > hematite > goethite. XRD and HRTEM were further employed to examine the morphologies of the four iron (oxyhydr)oxides before and after the four redox cycles in order to identify the possible formation of secondary minerals in the final aerobic samples (Figures 2 and S2). HRTEM confirmed that there were obvious morphological changes for lepidocrocite and ferrihydrite but not hematite and goethite after the redox cycles. In the lepidocrocite sample, many small nanoparticles were formed on the needle surface of lepidocrocite, and the XRD results showed the formation of new crystal phases including vivianite (no. 30-0662), goethite (no. 29-0713) and siderite (no. 29- 0696), which were also identified by HRTEM−SAED patterns (Figure 2). In the ferrihydrite sample, aggregations of small nanoparticles were observed but no granular crystalline particles were found. The XRD patterns of ferrihydrite showed a negligible change after the redox cycles, indicating that the amorphous structure of ferrihydrite was not changed, while many new nanocrystallites including goethite, lepidocrocite, hematite (no. 33-0664), and vivianite were found with HRTEM combined with the fast Fourier transform pattern (Figure S2a). Previous studies also found that goethite and lepidocrocite were formed in the presence of ferrihydrite and Fe(II) with or without S. oneidensis MR-1.18,53 Although negligible change was observed in the morphologies of hematite and goethite, some new nanocrystallites were found on their surfaces. HRTEM and related SAED patterns confirmed that after the redox cycles, the newly formed nanocrystallites included vivianite, metavivianite (no. 26- 1137), and hematite for goethite and vivianite and maghemite (no. 25-1402) for hematite, respectively (Figure S2b,c). These newly formed secondary minerals were the main components of the insoluble Fe(II) with the addition of surface-complexed Fe(II), which are expected to display strong chemical activities because of their nano-size and rough surfaces.53 Production of • OH during Iron Redox Cycles. Some recent studies have reported that the oxygenation of Fe(II)- containing minerals produces • OH through a Fenton-like mechanism.7,13,35 At the end of each anaerobic and aerobic stages, a given mass of sample was collected and oxidized with the addition of COU as the molecular probe to quantify the production of • OH.46 As shown in Figure 1c, the • OH was periodically produced during the redox cycles, consistent with the change trend of the Fe(II) content. A high level of • OH was detected upon oxygenation of the samples collected at the end of the anaerobic phase in all the four iron (oxyhydr)oxides due to the presence of sufficient Fe(II); whereas limited • OH was detected at the end of the aerobic phase, with the exception of lepidocrocite (Figure 1c), because some amount of Fe(II) (about 48 mg/g) remained in the lepidocrocite sample at the end of the aerobic phase. The amount of • OH formed due to the oxygenation of the anaerobic samples followed the order: lepidocrocite > ferrihydrite > hematite > goethite (Figure 1d), which was consistent with the microbial reduction ratios of the four iron (oxyhydr)oxides (Figure 1b).

The Fe(II) produced by microbial dissimilatory reduction included both dissolved Fe(II) and insoluble Fe(II). Separate oxygenation of the supernatants of the anaerobic samples did not result in the yield of detectable • OH, which was likely due to the absence of any kinds of precipitates or colloids to act as catalysts to produce H2O2, the necessary species in the Fenton reaction. There was sufficient Fe(II) produced by microbial dissimilatory reduction in the system; therefore the production of • OH should be limited by the formation of H2O2. 2 Previous studies have reported that insoluble Fe(II) especially those present as nanosized particles can accelerate the surfacemediated production of H2O2. 31,54 Therefore, insoluble Fe(II) especially those contained in the nanocrystallites formed during dissimilatory reduction was expected to accelerate the production of • OH. In order to further confirm the production • OH by insoluble Fe(II), we collected the microbially reduced iron (oxyhydr)oxide samples at different time intervals, which contained insoluble Fe(II) over a range of contents. The samples were then oxidized, and the content of • OH produced was measured. It was found that the • OH concentration was linearly correlated with the content of insoluble Fe(II) for each of the iron (oxyhydr)oxides (Table S3). However, the slope of the linear equation that represented the yield of • OH produced per unit insoluble Fe(II) was different for the four iron (oxyhydr)oxides (Figure S3 and Table S3), suggesting that the capacity for • OH production by oxygenation of Fe(II) was not only determined by the content of insoluble Fe(II) but also related to the mineralogical phase of the iron (oxyhydr)oxides. This may be due to the following reasons. First, the secondary minerals formed during microbial reduction of the four iron (oxyhydr)oxides were different (Figures 2 and S2) and had different capacities to produce • OH upon oxidation.55,56 Second, the morphologies of the iron (oxyhydr)oxides and the newly formed secondary minerals may influence the accessibility of oxygen to the insoluble Fe(II). For example, there existed a large number of micropores and nanopores in ferrihydrite and aggregations of the secondary minerals, which could inhibit the contact of oxygen, the precursor of • OH, to insoluble Fe(II).13,30 Although iron-reducing bacteria play important roles in dissimilatory reduction of Fe(III), whether they contribute to the production of • OH is still unknown, and only the abiotic pathway for the production of • OH during oxygenation of structural Fe(II) in clays has been investigated until now.13,30 An integrated pathway of • OH production in the microbially mediated redox cycling of iron needs to be clarified. Mechanism of • OH Production in Microbially Mediated Redox Cycling of Iron. The production of • OH usually needs the presence of the precursors such as O2 •− or H2O2. 32 Sekar and DiChristina50 have reported the production of H2O2 via microbial O2 respiration by S. oneidensis under aerobic conditions, but they did not consider the possible existence of O2 •− in the system. The production of H2O2 by microbial O2 respiration is generally considered to occur by the following pathways57 + → − •− O e (microbial) O 2 2 (1) +→ + •− + 2O 2H H O O 2 22 2 (2) As shown in eq 2, O2 •− is the precursor of H2O2; thus it is reasonable to speculate that O2 •− may be produced first by S. oneidensis. However, in a previous study by Diaz et al.,58 S. oneidensis MR-1 was considered incapable of producing O2 •−. It is hard to understand the formation of H2O2 by S. oneidensis without the prior formation of O2 •−. Therefore, we employed the highly sensitive MCLA-based flow-through CL method to detect online the production of O2 •− by S. oneidensis MR-1 under iron (oxyhydr)oxide-free conditions. First, we did not observe an increase in the CL signal intensity when the supernatants of S. oneidensis MR-1 were mixed with MCLA (Figure S4a), which is entirely consistent with the observation by Diaz et al.58 Interestingly and importantly, however, we observed an instant jump of CL signal intensity when the whole cell suspensions of S. oneidensis MR-1 were mixed with MCLA (Figure 3a), indicating the presence of O2 •−. It is likely that the O2 •− produced mainly accumulated on the surface of cell membranes, with limited diffusion distance because of its short lifetime and existence of the extracellular polymer layer;59,60 therefore no O2 •− was detected in the cell supernatants. In order to further confirm that it was O2 •− that induced the enhanced CL intensity of MCLA, the O2 •− scavenger SOD was added to the cell suspensions of S. oneidensis MR-1, and obvious inhibition of CL intensity was observed (Figure S4b). The CL intensity was also found to be inhibited when the cell suspensions were replaced with dead cell suspensions (Figure S4c), and the integral area of CL intensity was positively correlated (R2 = 0.95) with the natural logarithm value of the concentration of living cells of S. oneidensis MR-1 (Figure 3b). All these observations provided convincing evidences for the production of O2 •− by S. oneidensis MR-1. To our knowledge, this is the first time the production of O2 •− by S. oneidensis MR-1 has been observed. Previous studies have demonstrated that S. oneidensis MR-1 use the metal-reducing pathway to transfer electrons from the quinone/quinol pool in the cytoplasmic membrane through the periplasm and across the outer membrane to Fe(III) on mineral surfaces.24 It is theoretically feasible for S. oneidensis MR-1 to give electrons to O2 in a similar way, and flavins and c-type cytochromes may be responsible for the extracellular electron transfer from S. oneidensis MR-1 to O2. 61 About 14 μmol/L (∼109 cells/mL) of H2O2 was detected in the S. oneidensis MR-1 suspension, which was likely generated by the disproportionation reaction of O2 •− (eq 2). The production of both O2 •− and H2O2 provided a possibility for the formation of • OH through the Haber−Weiss reaction (eq 3) in the absence of iron.62 In fact, a small amount of • OH (0.35 μmol/L for ∼109 cells/mL) was detected in the suspension containing only S. oneidensis MR-1, indicating that this exogenetic ironindependent pathway for • OH production was feasible for S. oneidensis MR-1, although the yield of • OH through such a way was much lower than that in the iron (oxyhydr)oxidecontaining systems. + + → ++ •− + • O H O H H O O OH 2 22 2 2 (3) In order to unravel the formation pathway for the production of • OH during the microbially mediated redox transformation of iron (oxyhydr)oxides, the generation of the ROS possibly involved in the reactions, including • OH, 1 O2, O2 •−, and H2O2, was monitored upon the oxygenation of the samples collected at the end of the last anaerobic phase. FFA was used to detect the formation of 1 O2, and no loss of FFA was observed in the oxidation process (Figure S5), which excludes the production of 1 O2. The probe molecule XTT instead of MCLA-based online detection was used for the determination of O2 •− because the presence of iron (oxyhydr)- oxides significantly affected the CL signals produced by O2 •−. The formation of XTT formazan upon the oxygenation of the anaerobic samples indicated the presence of O2 •− (Figure 4a), and the concentration of O2 •− was consistent with the concentration of • OH detected. To further confirm the role of O2 •−, NBT, and SOD, scavengers of O2 •−, were added to the anaerobic samples and the production of • OH was quantified (Figure 4b). It was found that NBT suppressed the yield of • OH, whereas SOD greatly enhanced the production of • OH due to the fact that SOD can catalyze O2 •− to produce H2O2 63 and is favorable for the production of • OH. Previous studies have reported the abiotic formation of O2 •− by oneelectron transfer from insoluble Fe(II) to O2 (eq 4, in which Fe(II) and Fe(III) represent insoluble Fe(II) and Fe(III), respectively).35,64 In the present study, we for the first time confirmed that S. oneidensis MR-1 also directly contributed to the formation of O2 •− (eq 1).   +→ + •− Fe(II) O Fe(III) O 2 2 (4) The electron transfer from Fe(II) to O2 •− will result in the formation of H2O2 (eq 5).35 To confirm the role of H2O2 in the production of • OH, CAT, which can efficiently decompose H2O2, was added into the anaerobic samples, and the • OH concentration was measured after the aerobic phase. As shown in Figure 4c, the addition of CAT consistently decreased the • OH concentration for all the iron (oxyhydr)oxide samples, confirming that H2O2 participated in • OH production, likely through both the exogenetic iron-dependent Fenton65 or Fenton-like reactions54 (eq 6) and exogenetic iron-independent Haber−Weiss reaction62 (eq 3). In a recent study, Yu et al. reported on fungus-initiated catalytic reactions at hypha-iron (oxyhydr)oxide interfaces, in which Fe(III) was considered to be reduced by O2 •− to form Fe(II) and then reacted with H2O2 to produce • OH through a Fenton-like reaction.55 However, the contribution of such a pathway to the production of • OH was very limited in the systems containing ironreducing microorganisms and iron (oxyhydr)oxides because the majority of Fe(II) was produced by microbially mediated Fe(III) reduction instead of O2 •− induced Fe(III) reduction.   + + → + •− + Fe(II)/Fe(II) O 2H Fe(III)/Fe(III) H O 2 2 2 (5)   + → ++− • Fe(II)/Fe(II) H O Fe(III)/Fe(III) OH OH 2 2 (6) Overall, an integrated pathway of • OH production during S. oneidensis MR-1 mediated redox transformation of iron (oxyhydr)oxides was proposed (as shown in Figure 5). Under anaerobic conditions, Fe(III) in iron (oxyhydr)oxides was reduced by S. oneidensis MR-1 to form dissolved and insoluble Fe(II). When changed to aerobic conditions, O2 •− was first produced from the catalytic oxidation of O2 by both biological (eq 1) and abiotic (eq 4) pathways. Then, H2O2 was produced from O2 •− by both exogenetic iron-independent (eq 2) and exogenetic iron-dependent (eq 5) pathways. Finally, • OH was produced from O2 •− and H2O2 by the exogenetic iron-dependent Fenton or Fenton-like reaction (eq 6) or exogenetic iron-independent Haber−Weiss reaction (eq 3), of which the contribution of the Haber−Weiss reaction to the production of • OH was much lower than the Fenton-like reactions. However, the abiotic and biotic processes are highly coupled. S. oneidensis MR-1 participated in the production of • OH from four aspects through both direct and indirect processes. First, it dominated in microbial reduction of Fe(III) and then induced • OH generation via Fenton-like reactions. Second, it produced extracellular O2 •− and then induced the formation of • OH through exogenetic iron-independent reactions. Third, O2 •− and H2O2 derived from S. oneidensis MR-1 reacted with Fe(II) species to produce • OH through Fenton and Fenton-like mechanisms. Fourth, the nanosized secondary minerals formed during microbially mediated reduction accelerated the surface-mediated production of ROS.54 Therefore, it is very hard to separate the abiotic and biotic processes and to evaluate the relative importance of each role on ROS production. The situation in the real environment will be more complex, being dependent on many factors such as Eh/pH conditions, mineralogical compositions, and microbial communities. Environmental and Geochemical Implications. Oxidation of reduced Fe(II) in the natural environment has been evidenced to produce some amount of • OH; however, only the abiotic mechanism was previously considered responsible for its generation. The present study for the first time clarified the integrated generation pathways of • OH during the S. oneidensis MR-1-mediated redox transformation of iron (oxyhydr)oxides, including both exogenetic iron-dependent and exogenetic ironindependent pathways. S. oneidensis MR-1 plays key roles in both the formation of Fe(II)-containing secondary minerals and the production of extracellular O2 •− and thus mediated both of the pathways. The results improve our understanding of the coupling process of microbially mediated iron redox cycles and the natural occurrence of • OH production in the redox zones such as subsurface sediments, paddy soils, and so on. It is well known that iron redox cycles, especially Fe(II) oxidation and Fe(III) reduction in the natural environment, often couple with the biogeochemical cycles of carbon, nitrogen, sulfur, phosphorus, and other nutrients as well as the transformation of pollutants; however, little attention has been paid to the impact of • OH on these processes. As one of the strongest oxidants, • OH has the capacity to induce the decomposition of organic matter, the transformation of heavy metals and the degradation of organic contaminants. Therefore, naturally produced • OH during iron redox cycles must contribute to these environmental and geochemical processes. In addition, this study confirmed that the production of • OH during microbially mediated redox transformation of iron (oxyhydr)oxides was dependent on the mineralogical phases of the minerals as well as the newly formed secondary minerals. This will help us to evaluate the • OH production potential of environmental media such as soils and sediments, as well as to select appropriate iron materials to obtain a high level of • OH in the practice of contamination remediation. Moreover, both environmental factors and microbial communities will impact the formation of • OH in soils and sediments. More sophisticated investigations combining mineralogical and microbiological factors to evaluate the formation of • OH under natural field conditions are critically necessary in the future.
